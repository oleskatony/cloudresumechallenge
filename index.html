							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In my transition from restaurant manager to cloud computing professional, I've learned that the ingredients for success are not so different in the restaurant and tech industries. With four years of management experience, alongside 650+ hours of experience in AWS, I bring a fresh perspective and a passion for innovation to every project.

							Looking ahead, I'm eager to take on new challenges and continue growing in my role as a cloud professional.</p>
							<p>On this website, you'll find a collection of my AWS labs and projects, showcasing my skills in Cloud Architecture, Security, Troubleshooting, and Automation. Whether you're an employer looking for a skilled cloud engineer or just curious about AWS, I invite you to browse through my portfolio and see the work I've done. Thank you for visiting!</p>

						<h2>AWS Cloud Resume Challenge</h2>
					</header>
					<p>This website was created as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge, an exciting initiative designed to highlight skills and explore various aspects of cloud computing. This project emphasizes the abilities required for a successful career in the cloud industry. For this endeavor, I focused on utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my preferred cloud provider. If you would like learn more about my attempt of the Cloud Resume Challenge, please check out my <a href="https://github.com/oleskatony/cloudresumechallenge" target="_blank">Github</a> page that documents some of the components of this project.</p>
					<p>This project has been an excellent learning experience that solidified my understanding of key cloud concepts. By applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform, implementing serverless solutions with DynamoDB and Lambda, and adopting CI/CD practices for website deployment, I have witnessed firsthand the efficiency and potential of AWS cloud. I highly encourage others to take on this challenge as it not only helps in developing cloud skills but also serves as a remarkable platform to showcase their abilities.</p>		</section>
