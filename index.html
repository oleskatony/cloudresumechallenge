							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In my transition from restaurant manager to cloud computing professional, I've learned that the ingredients for success are not so different in the restaurant and tech industries. With four years of management experience, alongside 650+ hours of experience in AWS, I bring a fresh perspective and a passion for innovation to every project.

							Looking ahead, I'm eager to take on new challenges and continue growing in my role as a cloud professional.</p>
							<p>Whether you're an employer looking for a skilled cloud engineer or just curious about my experience with AWS, I invite you to browse through my portfolio and see the work I've done. Thank you for visiting!</p>

						<h2>AWS Cloud Resume Challenge</h2>
					</header>
					<p>This website was created as part of the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/" target="_blank">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>, an exciting initiative designed to highlight skills and explore various aspects of cloud computing. This project emphasizes the abilities required for a successful career in the cloud industry. For this endeavor, I focused on utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my preferred cloud provider. If you would like learn more about my attempt of the Cloud Resume Challenge, please check out my <a href="https://github.com/oleskatony/cloudresumechallenge" target="_blank">Github</a> page that documents some of the components of this project.</p>
					<p>This project has been an excellent learning experience that solidified my understanding of key cloud concepts. By applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform, implementing serverless solutions with DynamoDB and Lambda, and adopting CI/CD practices for website deployment, I have witnessed firsthand the efficiency and potential of AWS. I highly encourage others to take on this challenge as it not only helps in developing cloud skills but also serves as a remarkable platform to showcase their abilities.</p>

						<h2>3 Tier Architecture</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To enhance my proficiency in AWS, I enthusiastically took on a project that involved provisioning resources for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture" target="_blank">3-tier architecture</a>. Multi-tier architecture is widely adopted in the industry, prioritizing security, high availability, and scalability by separating (decoupling) resources into 3 distinct layers or tiers.</p>
					<p>This project served as a valuable complement to my prior involvement in the Cloud Resume Challenge, where my focus centered around serverless solutions. However, in this particular undertaking, I leveraged EC2 instances, multi-AZ RDS, and VPC components to design a solution akin to what one might encounter in a large enterprise environment.</p>
					<p>In addition to designing and implementing the infrastructure for this project, I dedicated myself to creating a <a href="https://github.com/oleskatony/3-tier-architecture/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">comprehensive breakdown</a> of the entire undertaking. This involved thorough documentation, accompanied by supporting images and a <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128739036/250661984-d4ccc897-232c-4c5b-a051-18b3e436d31e.png" target="_blank">diagram</a> illustrating the architecture.</p>
